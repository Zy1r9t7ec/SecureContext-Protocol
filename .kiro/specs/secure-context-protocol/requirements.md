# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SecureContext Protocol (SCP) MVP is an open-source system designed to demonstrate secure, user-consented OAuth 2.0 access mediation with multiple authentication providers. Initially supporting Google and Microsoft services, the system is architected for extensibility to integrate additional authentication endpoints in the future. The system enables AI agents to securely access fragmented personalized user data by implementing a pluggable Authentication Proxy that handles OAuth flows and securely passes obtained access tokens. This MVP focuses on core usability through a simple web interface, robust token management, and a modular provider architecture that supports community contributions and enterprise extensions.

## Requirements

6. WHEN token storage is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect to the UI with the session ID as a query parameter

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure OAuth client credentials through environment variables and provider configuration files, so that I can securely manage API keys and easily add new authentication providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load OAuth client credentials from environment variables for all configured providers
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which provider configurations are incomplete
3. WHEN setting up the application THEN the system SHALL provide a .env.example file with placeholder values for all supported providers
4. IF credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL handle authentication errors gracefully and indicate which provider failed
5. WHEN new providers are added THEN the system SHALL support dynamic provider registration through configuration files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI agent or external system, I want to retrieve stored tokens using a session ID, so that I can access user data with proper authorization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid session ID is provided THEN the system SHALL return the associated tokens as JSON
2. WHEN an invalid session ID is provided THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response
3. WHEN tokens are retrieved THEN the response SHALL include access_token, refresh_token, expires_at, and scope
4. WHEN the token endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL validate the session ID format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the status of my OAuth connections through a simple web interface, so that I can confirm successful authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the root URL THEN the system SHALL display connection buttons for Google and Microsoft
2. WHEN OAuth flow completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success message with the session ID
3. WHEN OAuth flow fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the page loads with a session ID parameter THEN the system SHALL update the display to show connection status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify token retrieval functionality through a command-line script, so that I can test the token passing mechanism.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the verification script is run with a session ID THEN it SHALL make an HTTP request to the token endpoint
2. WHEN tokens are successfully retrieved THEN the script SHALL display the token information in the console
3. WHEN the session ID is invalid THEN the script SHALL handle the error gracefully
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the script SHALL provide meaningful error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle OAuth errors gracefully, so that I receive clear feedback when authentication fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user denies OAuth consent THEN the system SHALL redirect to the UI with an error message
2. WHEN OAuth state validation fails THEN the system SHALL display a security error message
3. WHEN network issues occur during token exchange THEN the system SHALL provide a user-friendly error message
4. WHEN token exchange fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and inform the user appropriately

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my tokens to be stored temporarily and securely, so that my authentication data is not permanently persisted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tokens are stored THEN the system SHALL use in-memory storage for temporary access
2. WHEN the application restarts THEN all stored tokens SHALL be cleared from memory
3. WHEN tokens are accessed THEN the system SHALL validate session ownership
4. IF token storage exceeds reasonable limits THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup mechanisms

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily add new OAuth 2.0 providers to the system, so that I can extend the protocol to support additional authentication endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new provider THEN the system SHALL support provider registration through a standardized configuration interface
2. WHEN a new provider is configured THEN the system SHALL automatically generate the appropriate OAuth routes
3. WHEN provider-specific scopes are defined THEN the system SHALL validate and use them in OAuth flows
4. WHEN custom provider logic is needed THEN the system SHALL support provider-specific handlers through a plugin architecture

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As an open source contributor, I want clear documentation and modular code structure, so that I can contribute new providers and improvements to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL have clear separation between core OAuth logic and provider-specific implementations
2. WHEN adding new functionality THEN the system SHALL follow established coding standards and patterns
3. WHEN documenting providers THEN the system SHALL include standardized provider configuration examples
